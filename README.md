Hi there, thanks for the fun take-home exercise! I appreciate and respect companies who opt for take-home assessments instead of archaic whiteboard interviews. Take-homes are much more realistic, which helps paint a better picture of your candidate's overall skills.

I used only Next.js with no extras, to keep things short and simple. I did consider using [bignumber.js](https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/) since we're dealing with money but since it's only an exercise I decided against it.

## Set-up intructions
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
